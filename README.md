# FASER-2-MPhys-Project

This is the GitHub repository containing all the code files for my 2023-2024 MPhys Project.

This project aims to investigate the ability to align the FASER-2 detector by studying the simulated background radiation. We will propagate the simulated muon flux through the detector, assuming perfect alignment and recording what the expected results are. We will then intentionally misalign the detector geometry before propagating the flux through the detector again, recording the results. We then investigate whether we can predict the misalignment from this data by comparing it to the simulated perfectly aligned data.

The ROOT files containing the actual data for this project will be stored in my university OneDrive account as they are too large to be stored here (Gigabytes), for access please contact me at luke.kennedy@chch.ox.ac.uk.
